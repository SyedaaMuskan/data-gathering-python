# Data Gathering using Python

This repository contains my hands-on practice for learning how to gather and clean data using Python.

## What I Practiced
- Loading CSV files from a URL
- Understanding when to use pandas.read_csv vs requests
- Fetching data from REST APIs
- Working with JSON data
- Flattening nested JSON using pandas.json_normalize
- Selecting, renaming, and cleaning columns
- Exporting cleaned data to CSV files

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Requests

## Why This Project
Data gathering and cleaning is the first and most important step in any Machine Learning or Data Science project.  
This practice helped me understand real-world data formats and common issues while handling them.

## Status
Learning in progress 🚀
